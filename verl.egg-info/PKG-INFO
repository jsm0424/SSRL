           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions

              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf

              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# 🎉News

- **[2025-08-18]** We are honored to be featured as 🤗 [HuggingFace Daily Paper #2](https://huggingface.co/papers/date/2025-08-18). 
- **[2025-08-15]** We present **SSRL** (Self-Search Reinforcement Learning), an investigation for Agentic Search RL without reliance on external search engine.
  
# 📖Introduction

**We investigate Reinforcement Learning (RL) on Agentic search tasks without explicit gathering information from external search engines, e.g., LLMs, web engines.**
Previous work leverage external search engines during training, which is expensive and time-consuming, yet introducing training instability. We introduce SSRL, a novel approach that enables RL on Agentic search tasks without the need for explicit search engines which achieves comparable performance to previous methods. Though trained totally offline, it can be seamlessly applied to online search engines, and further boost its performance.

# 📊Main Results

We first show that the high upper bound of Self-Search by using structured prompt, with the LLM serving as the search engine and the policy simultaneously.

</p>

After that, we experiment on SSRL to teach LLMs how to leverage self-search capabilities effectively. Our results demonstrate that SSRL consistently improves performance across a variety of tasks and models.

Furthermore, although SSRL is trained offline, it can be seamlessly applied to online search engines, further boosting its performance.

# ✨Getting Started

You can reproduce the results of SSRL with the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TsinghuaC3I/SSRL
cd verl

pip install -r requirements.txt

huggingface-cli download --repo-type dataset --resume-download TsinghuaC3I/SSRL --local-dir SSRL_dataset # download the dataset

bash examples/ssrl/example.sh
```

To evaluate the trained model with Sim2Real generalization, you can run:

```bash
bash examples/ssrl/sim2real.sh
```

If you want to try entropy guided Sim2Real generalization, turn on the `trainer.use_entropy` flag in the `sim2real.sh` script.

*All experiments were conducted on 8 x NVIDIA A800 80GB GPUs.*
